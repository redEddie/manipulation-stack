One HDF5 file per task/language-instruction, one ``demo_N`` group per episode,
matching the official per-task file layout (e.g.
``turn_on_the_stove_demo.hdf5``).

Deliberately dropped vs. the simulator-generated original: ``states`` and
``model_file`` (full MuJoCo sim state / scene XML -- meaningless for a real
robot) and a genuine ``env_args`` (there is no BDDL scene/controller config to
report). ``env_args``/``problem_info`` are still written as JSON so
``get_dataset_info.py``-style readers do not KeyError, but ``env_args`` is a
real-robot stub, not simulator-replayable metadata.

ACTION SPACE -- read this before trusting a trained policy
------------------------------------------------------------
GELLO teleop here drives the follower in **joint space** (the leader mirrors
the follower's joints 1:1); there is no native commanded end-effector delta.
To stay drop-in compatible with LIBERO-format consumers (which assume a
robosuite ``OSC_POSE`` controller), ``actions`` is reconstructed *after the
fact* from the realized Cartesian trajectory: at frame ``t`` it is the
world-frame delta pose that carried ``ee_pos_quat[t] -> ee_pos_quat[t+1]``,
normalized by the OSC_POSE defaults (``output_max`` = 0.05 m / 0.5 rad),
clipped to [-1, 1]. Gripper: -1=open / +1=close (robosuite Panda convention).
Frame convention and gripper sign are taken from robosuite's documented
defaults, not verified byte-for-byte against an official demo file (repeated
attempts to stream one in this sandbox hit transient network failures --
before training anything on this data, sanity-check a few saved episodes by
eye: gripper sign flips exactly when the operator's trigger did, and replaying
cumulative ``actions`` roughly reproduces ``ee_states``).

Realized-trajectory actions lose the operator's force intent wherever the
follower is in contact: the leader keeps commanding *through* the obstacle
while the realized pose barely moves, so a realized delta goes to ~zero
exactly where the demonstration is pressing. They also break closed-loop
execution outright -- see ``compute_joint_absolute_action`` for the measured
consequences (backward regression at every replan, 1.3-2.0x slowdown). The
``joint_absolute`` space therefore records the **leader's command**, matching
ACT/ALOHA. To keep that intent recoverable for the other spaces too,
every episode ALSO stores the raw teleop command stream (independent of the
selected action space; see ``save_episode``)::

    obs/commanded_joint_states    (T, 7) float32  -- GELLO leader joints (rad),
                                                     the command sent at frame t
    obs/commanded_gripper_states  (T, 1) float32  -- commanded gripper, 0=open..1=closed

Same principle for the robot's own force/torque estimates (2026-08-23) --
franka computes them at 1 kHz anyway, they are tiny (20 floats/frame), and
they are the only record of contact the realized trajectory hides, so they
are written whenever the caller supplies them, independent of the schema.
HDF5-original only; the LeRobot converter does not consume them

                                                     the EE frame)

    obs/cartesian_contact         (T, 6) float32  -- ditto per Cartesian dimension

``scripts/convert/derive_commanded_ee_actions.py`` turns these into commanded EE
delta actions (``actions_ee`` / ``actions_world_cmd``) offline via FR3
forward kinematics -- no extra dependency in the collection loop.

    background save never stalls the operator), and repack rewrites them with
    ``gzip``. Anything already gzip has been repacked.

    **Every episode is checked, not just the first.** A file that was repacked

    finished and silently drops it from the repack selection, which is exactly
    the file that still has uncompressed episodes in it. So a mixed file counts
    as not repacked, and the marker cannot override that.
