Split out of the former mstack/gui/gui_widgets.py (emptied in the 5-3 refactor) so that
widgets and workspace code can import small, single-purpose modules without
dragging in unrelated Qt classes.

# BLAS/parallel-executor thread pool sized to the CPU core count (measured:
# 39 extra OS threads on this 20-core machine, for a GUI that does no heavy
# matrix math or bulk image processing at all). Setting these first keeps
# that pool at 1 with zero measured functional difference for this script's
# actual workload (light resize/color-convert calls). Don't copy this into
# scripts/convert/convert_libero_to_lerobot.py -- that one genuinely benefits from
