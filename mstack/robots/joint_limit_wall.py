"""A one-sided joint-limit wall for a GELLO leader, driven in current mode.

The leader turns through poses the follower cannot reach, and driving the
follower at one of those commands speed it is not allowed near a limit -- on the
FR3 that trips the speed-limit reflex.  Rather than clamp the follower's command
(which decouples the two arms and leaves the operator pushing through a dead
zone), push back on the *leader* so the limit is felt and never crossed.

The same loop optionally drives the *trigger* servo as a spring (see
``gripper_open_close``): a light constant current toward open while the trigger
is squeezed or held, swapping to a stronger return push once the trigger swings
open -- so the squeeze can be soft under the finger without slowing the
snap-back -- plus an exponentially rising squeeze resistance from the
follower's binary close threshold up to full close.  The exponential shape is
deliberate: felt intensity is roughly logarithmic in the stimulus
(Weber-Fechner), so an exponential current reads as a linearly increasing
"gripping harder" cue.  It lives in this thread because ``set_current``
sync-writes the *whole* servo vector -- a second writer would stomp this one.

The wall runs its own high-rate thread: the position->current loop needs a few
hundred Hz to stay stiff without buzzing, far above the ~100 Hz teleop loop.  It
*shares* a ``DynamixelDriver`` -- and that driver's bus lock -- with whoever else
reads it (the teleop agent); it opens no port of its own.

The same thread also drives an optional "pose-match assist" (see
``set_match_target``): a two-sided current-mode spring-damper that pulls the
arm servos onto an arbitrary target pose, e.g. the follower's reset pose, so
the operator doesn't have to nudge the leader there by hand joint-by-joint.
The pull is shaped as an *attractive well* (2026-08-31, issue #37A) rather
than a spring that grows without bound: each joint's match current is scaled
by ``1 / (1 + (err/match_well_rad)^2)``, so the force peaks around
``match_well_rad`` and then fades as ``1/err``. Close in it holds firmly;
pull a joint well away and the motor lets go, by design. That is what makes
the arm steerable by hand -- notably when unwinding a cable by turning a
joint a full revolution, where a plain spring would fight the whole way and
then drag the joint back the short way round, re-twisting what was just
undone. The envelope is smooth everywhere (a rational function -- one divide,
no exp, and no kink to jerk the motor), and it is per joint: the one being
turned goes soft while the rest keep holding the arm up. Beyond
``match_arm_rad`` the servos are cut to torque-off entirely, since current
control at ~0 mA still drags more than no torque at all.

The shaping lives here rather than in the callers because the rule it
enforces is about the hardware: put the leader down anywhere you like and
nothing over-torques. A second guard covers what the envelope cannot -- a
joint stuck at its current cap for ``match_stall_s`` seconds (jammed, or a
hand holding it near the target where the assist is at full strength) means
the pull is losing, so the assist gives up and latches off until the caller
sets a target again; servos are more expensive than one alignment.
It lives here for the same reason the limit spring does -- ``set_current``
sync-writes the whole servo vector, so a second control loop calling it
concurrently would fight this one over the bus. Arming follows the assist per
joint: a joint within ``match_arm_rad`` of its target is energized, the rest
stay torque-off, and clearing the target (typically right after ``status()``
reports ``match_done``) drops them all back to the limit-only rule -- so the
leader goes back to being freely back-drivable for teleop with no extra
cleanup call.

One place the wall deliberately stops being a wall: half a turn from a
joint's range centre, ``wrap_into_limits`` flips which turn it reports, so the
same physical pose reads as "past the upper limit" one tick and "past the
lower limit" the next, and the limit spring reverses at full strength --
violent chatter. The previous automatic wrap-zone hand-over (which cut torque
near the flip point to let the operator unwind a cable) has been disabled;
the wall now keeps every joint under control at all times.

Gains/tolerances below are untuned defaults (no access to the real leader
while writing this) -- expect to retune
``match_kp``/``match_kd``/``match_max_current`` on hardware.

The same thread also optionally drives a lightweight, *empirical* gravity
compensation + stiction dither (see ``set_gravity_comp``, GitHub issue #3's
"③"/"④") -- NOT the model-based RNEA-on-a-URDF approach FACTR uses
(upstream GELLO's ``factr/gravity_compensation.py``, not carried into this
repository), because there is no URDF (mass/
inertia) for this leader and none is available to build one from. Instead
each arm joint gets an independent single-pendulum approximation,
``tau_g_i = gravity_gains[i] * sin(q_i - gravity_offsets[i])`` -- ignores
cross-coupling between joints (a real chain's gravity load on joint i also
depends on joints i+1..n's angles; this doesn't), but needs only two
hand-tunable numbers per joint instead of a full dynamics model, and is
tunable live on the real leader by feel ("does it float here?") via
``set_gravity_comp``. Both arrays default to all-zero -- every joint's
compensation is simply off, and it has stayed off: the one real-hardware
tuning pass did not behave right, and the suspect is this per-joint
single-pendulum approximation itself rather than the numbers fed to it
(GitHub issue #3). Reviving this needs a leader URDF or bigger servos, not
another tuning session.
Unlike the limit spring and match assist, gravity comp is meant to be on
essentially continuously while a human might be holding the leader, so a
non-zero ``gravity_gains`` force-arms the arm servos unconditionally (like
an active match target), not just near a limit.

Stiction dither (``stiction_gain``) is a small square-wave added on top,
proportional to that joint's own ``tau_g`` and flipping sign every tick
while ``|dq| < stiction_vel_tol``, to nudge a joint through static friction
right at the point gravity comp alone leaves it just barely not moving
(FACTR's same rationale) -- meaningless while gravity comp is off (its own
gain is zero everywhere), so there is nothing separate to tune first.

Faults are deliberately blunt (see the teleop integration design): on any fault
the thread stores the exception and exits without cleanup, and ``poll()``
re-raises it so the caller dies.  The servos keep their last current; the
Dynamixel overload protection is the backstop.  ``stop()`` is the *clean* exit
path (normal shutdown) and does zero the current and drop torque.
